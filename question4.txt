Question 4:-. Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.

Answer :- 
Tag:
An HTML tag is a snippet of code enclosed within angle brackets ("<" and ">") that defines the purpose and
structure of a specific element on a webpage. Tags are used to instruct the web browser how to display the
content they enclose. Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag, with the name of the
element enclosed within the tags.

<h1> This is heading.</h1>

In this example, <h1> is the opening tag, and </h1> is the closing tag. The content "This is heading." is the
text within the heading element.

Element:
An HTML element is a complete unit that includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. It represents a
distinct part of a webpage's content or structure. Elements are composed of tags and the content enclosed
between those tags.
In the example, <h1> is the opening tag, "This is heading." is the content, and </h1> is the closing tag.
Together, they form the complete <h1> element, representing a heading of text.
